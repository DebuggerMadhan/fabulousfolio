This a amazing site with css and js animations that make this "Fabulous"

First of all clone my repository in your machine.
```
  git clone https://github.com/MadhanDevlpr/fabulousfolio.git
```

You can replace the Name with your name in the Web page's title and the header of that, I hope it's easy for you.

And the another thing is to integrate formcarry to your form in the last section

```
  <form data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-delay="2000" data-aos-once="true" action="https://formcarry.com/s/**yourformcarryID**" method="POST" accept-charset="UTF-8" >
```
And you can add all your projects title and some content about it and change the text in the footer.

If you completed all that and you are satisfied with Fabulousfolio, please star me on github.


I've also added two of my projects in the live demo.
